# WebDesignProject1

This project loads a login page where users can create or sign into an existing account. Next, they can search a book by its isbn, title, or author. The user can then select a result from a list of links and will then be provided with details. Finally, they can submit a review and view other users reviews.

All of this is done using flask (which handles messaging the database through sqlalchemy), bootstrap, and html.
